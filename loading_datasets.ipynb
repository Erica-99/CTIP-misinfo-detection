       "      <td>The Reason Why Jade Helm Is Obama’s Favorite Conspiracy Theory May Surprise You By Kristie on November 22, 2015 Subscribe \\nPresident Obama has had to deal with his fair share of conspiracy theories. Even before he was elected he had to deal with questions about his origin of birth. He’s also secretly a Muslim masquerading as a Christian. One of the best is that he is going to unarm Americans by taking our guns. I’m still waiting on that one. But in a recent GQ interview , President Obama revealed his favorite conspiracy theory – Jade Helm. Featured image by Boricuaeddie , available under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial license. \\nAs most will recall, Jade Helm was one of the largest military training exercise ever conducted on U.S. soil. In July of this year, roughly 1,200 U.S. military troops participated in exercises that spanned seven states. Jade Helm included New Mexico, Arizona, and Texas. As we all know though, this exercise proved itself to be a great opportunity for the bitter right-wing to start up the conspiracy machine. \\nWhile this resulted in great ratings for the likes of Alex Jones , Jade Helm turned out to be a — military exercise — not a military led plot for Obama to take over the country and stay in power as a dictator. No wonder Jade Helm entertained Obama. Only a right-wing nut-job would believe something like that. \\nBut why is that Obama’s favorite conspiracy theory? He explained after GQ asked : “What’s the most entertaining conspiracy theory you ever read about yourself?” \\nObama then answered : “That military exercises we were doing in Texas were designed to begin martial law so that I could usurp the Constitution and stay in power longer. Anybody who thinks I could get away with telling Michelle I’m going to be president any longer than eight years does not know my wife.” \\nYou see, even the leader of the free world answers to somebody.

       "      <td>U.S. President Donald Trump s revised hardline policy towards Iran will have little impact on Tehran s ambition to develop its vital oil industry and attract foreign investment, a senior Iranian official said on Tuesday. The Islamic Republic hopes to signs 10 new deals with foreign companies to develop oil and gas fields by March 2018, Amir Zamaninia, Iran s deputy oil minister for trade and international affairs, told the Oil &amp; Money conference in London. Trump s decision last Friday not to certify that Iran was complying with last year s international deal on its nuclear power development program will not detract from Tehran s plans, he said.  I don t think any of us, or any of our partners have been surprised by this statement. Our expectations of policy formulation from Washington have been very measured,  he said.  The (U.S.) statement and policy ... has little or no effect and implication on our future plan in the oil industry,  Zamaninia said. Iran is negotiating 28 contracts with foreign companies, including many of Europe s top oil companies, under a new development contract, he added. France s Total (TOTF.PA) became in July the first Western oil major to re-enter Iran following the lifting of international sanctions with an agreement to develop the giant South Pars offshore gas field. Total s chief executive officer said in an interview with International Oil Daily the company will wait to see the impact of Trump s decision and that it will try to continue with it if the United States imposes unilateral sanctions.  We have signed a contract in Iran. If we can move forward, we ll move forward. If we cannot, we will have to stop,  Patrick Pouyanne said. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) has also signed an agreement with Iran for the possible development of oil and gas fields. Iran, which holds the world s largest gas reserves, plans to boost its gas production to 1.1 billion cubic meters per day by 2021 from the current 800 million bcm per day, Zamaninia said.  The OPEC member also aims to raise its oil production capacity to 4.7 million barrels per day by 2021 from the current 3.8 million bpd, he said. He said that the major oilfields</td>\n",

       "      <td>A Brazilian congressional report recommended on Tuesday that President Michel Temer should not face trial for obstruction of justice and membership in a criminal organization, arguing that the charges against him were unfounded. The report by Congressman Bonifacio de Andrada, a Temer ally, also recommended shelving charges against two of his cabinet ministers stemming from a corruption case involving bribes paid by meatpacker JBS SA.  The constitutional and legal affairs committee in Brazil s Congress was expected to approve the report next week. The full lower house, which has the power to decide whether a president should be put on trial by the Supreme Court, will likely close the case a week later. That victory for Temer would all but ensure that Brazil s most unpopular modern day president will survive the crisis and serve out his term through the end of 2018. But fighting off the charges has seriously delayed and could derail the president s efforts to balance Brazil s government accounts.  Temer took office last year after the impeachment of his leftist predecessor Dilma Rousseff. He vowed to clean up the government in the midst of Brazil s worst corruption scandal. Instead he was accused of taking bribes and condoning the payment of hush money to a jailed politician in plea bargain testimony by Joesley Batista, an owner of JBS, the world s largest meatpacker. Temer has denied any wrongdoing and his lawyers argued that the case against him was flawed because it was based on one man s word and an inconclusive recording that Batista secretly made of a conversation with the president. Andrada said the charges were based on  bogus  plea bargain statements that do not warrant criminal prosecution.  There is no evidence of a criminal organization, but rather political activities that are being treated as criminal acts,  he said in his report that he read out to the committee. Temer aides said they were confident the chamber would shelve the charges by a bigger margin than its rejection of an earlier corruption charge on August 2 by 263-227 votes, when it needed only 172 votes to throw the case out. A survey by Brasilia-based consultancy Arko Advice published this week showed that support for the government has increased in Congress since August and 71 percent of the 212 lawmakers polled believe the new charges against Temer would be rejected. Still, it is unclear whether Temer can win approval this year for his plan to overhaul the costly pension system, the key measure to reduce a bulging budget deficit that cost Brazil its investment grade credit rating two years ago. A senior executive for Moody s Investors Service said on Tuesday that failure to pass pension reform would make it  easier  to decide on maintaining a negative outlook for Brazil s sovereign rating early next year.</td>\n",

They ve never been afraid to tackle controversial and volatile issues within the context of the show, and that includes the 2016 presidential election. And why not? We have Donald Trump this year. He s walking cannon fodder.This video deals with the importance of the 3 a.m. phone call at the White House that means the world s about to end, and looks at how both Hillary and Trump would handle it. They lampoon Hillary here, too, but that s all they do. However, they tear into, and destroy, any and all illusions that anybody may have that Trump would actually make, well, any kind of a president at all.The spoof asks the viewer to consider who they want to vote for based on how each candidate reacts to that crucial 3 a.m. phone call. Watch it below, and remember that guffawing at Trump is perfectly okay.Trump likes to pawn an awful lot off onto other people. Who would he pawn that 3 a.m. phone call off onto while he went back to sleep in the gold-plated bed he ll no doubt have brought into the Lincoln Bedroom following his triumph over Hillary? In the end, though, what this spoof does is put Trump s (ahem) leadership capabilities under a very uncomfortable microscope, as well it should.Featured image via screen capture from embedded video</td>\n",

Featured image by Boricuaeddie , available under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial license. \\nAs most will recall, Jade Helm was one of the largest military training exercise ever conducted on U.S. soil. In July of this year, roughly 1,200 U.S. military troops participated in exercises that spanned seven states. Jade Helm included New Mexico, Arizona, and Texas. As we all know though, this exercise proved itself to be a great opportunity for the bitter right-wing to start up the conspiracy machine. \\nWhile this resulted in great ratings for the likes of Alex Jones , Jade Helm turned out to be a — military exercise — not a military led plot for Obama to take over the country and stay in power as a dictator. No wonder Jade Helm entertained Obama. Only a right-wing nut-job would believe something like that. \\nBut why is that Obama’s favorite conspiracy theory? He explained after GQ asked : “What’s the most entertaining conspiracy theory you ever read about yourself?” \\nObama then answered : “That military exercises we were doing in Texas were designed to begin martial law so that I could usurp the Constitution and stay in power longer. Anybody who thinks I could get away with telling Michelle I’m going to be president any longer than eight years does not know my wife.” \\nYou see, even the leader of the free world answers to somebody.

The Islamic Republic hopes to signs 10 new deals with foreign companies to develop oil and gas fields by March 2018, Amir Zamaninia, Iran s deputy oil minister for trade and international affairs, told the Oil & Money conference in London. Trump s decision last Friday not to certify that Iran was complying with last year s international deal on its nuclear power development program will not detract from Tehran s plans, he said.  I don t think any of us, or any of our partners have been surprised by this statement. Our expectations of policy formulation from Washington have been very measured,  he said.  The (U.S.) statement and policy ... has little or no effect and implication on our future plan in the oil industry,  Zamaninia said. Iran is negotiating 28 contracts with foreign companies, including many of Europe s top oil companies, under a new development contract, he added. France s Total (TOTF.PA) became in July the first Western oil major to re-enter Iran following the lifting of international sanctions with an agreement to develop the giant South Pars offshore gas field. Total s chief executive officer said in an interview with International Oil Daily the company will wait to see the impact of Trump s decision and that it will try to continue with it if the United States imposes unilateral sanctions.  We have signed a contract in Iran. If we can move forward, we ll move forward. If we cannot, we will have to stop,  Patrick Pouyanne said. Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) has also signed an agreement with Iran for the possible development of oil and gas fields. Iran, which holds the world s largest gas reserves, plans to boost its gas production to 1.1 billion cubic meters per day by 2021 from the current 800 million bcm per day, Zamaninia said.  The OPEC member also aims to raise its oil production capacity to 4.7 million barrels per day by 2021 from the current 3.8 million bpd, he said. He said that the major oilfields   \n",
       "2  A Brazilian congressional report recommended on Tuesday that President Michel Temer should not face trial for obstruction of justice and membership in a criminal organization, arguing that the charges against him were unfounded. The report by Congressman Bonifacio de Andrada, a Temer ally, also recommended shelving charges against two of his cabinet ministers stemming from a corruption case involving bribes paid by meatpacker JBS SA.  The constitutional and legal affairs committee in Brazil s Congress was expected to approve the report next week. The full lower house, which has the power to decide whether a president should be put on trial by the Supreme Court, will likely close the case a week later. That victory for Temer would all but ensure that Brazil s most unpopular modern day president will survive the crisis and serve out his term through the end of 2018. But fighting off the charges has seriously delayed and could derail the president s efforts to balance Brazil s government accounts.  Temer took office last year after the impeachment of his leftist predecessor Dilma Rousseff. He vowed to clean up the government in the midst of Brazil s worst corruption scandal. Instead he was accused of taking bribes and condoning the payment of hush money to a jailed politician in plea bargain testimony by Joesley Batista, an owner of JBS, the world s largest meatpacker. Temer has denied any wrongdoing and his lawyers argued that the case against him was flawed because it was based on one man s word and an inconclusive recording that Batista secretly made of a conversation with the president. Andrada said the charges were based on  bogus  plea bargain statements that do not warrant criminal prosecution.  There is no evidence of a criminal organization, but rather political activities that are being treated as criminal acts,  he said in his report that he read out to the committee. Temer aides said they were confident the chamber would shelve the charges by a bigger margin than its rejection of an earlier corruption charge on August 2 by 263-227 votes, when it needed only 172 votes to throw the case out. A survey by Brasilia-based consultancy Arko Advice published this week showed that support for the government has increased in Congress since August and 71 percent of the 212 lawmakers polled believe the new charges against Temer would be rejected. Still, it is unclear whether Temer can win approval this year for his plan to overhaul the costly pension system, the key measure to reduce a bulging budget deficit that cost Brazil its investment grade credit rating two years ago. A senior executive for Moody s Investors Service said on Tuesday that failure to pass pension reform would make it  easier  to decide on maintaining a negative outlook for Brazil s sovereign rating early next year.   \n",

They ve never been afraid to tackle controversial and volatile issues within the context of the show, and that includes the 2016 presidential election. And why not? We have Donald Trump this year. He s walking cannon fodder.This video deals with the importance of the 3 a.m. phone call at the White House that means the world s about to end, and looks at how both Hillary and Trump would handle it. They lampoon Hillary here, too, but that s all they do. However, they tear into, and destroy, any and all illusions that anybody may have that Trump would actually make, well, any kind of a president at all.The spoof asks the viewer to consider who they want to vote for based on how each candidate reacts to that crucial 3 a.m. phone call. Watch it below, and remember that guffawing at Trump is perfectly okay.Trump likes to pawn an awful lot off onto other people. Who would he pawn that 3 a.m. phone call off onto while he went back to sleep in the gold-plated bed he ll no doubt have brought into the Lincoln Bedroom following his triumph over Hillary? In the end, though, what this spoof does is put Trump s (ahem) leadership capabilities under a very uncomfortable microscope, as well it should.Featured image via screen capture from embedded video   \n",
